# NGS Data Quality Control and Sequence Refinement Pipeline
# 1. Project Introduction
This repository provides a complete automated workflow for the processing of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. In modern genomics, raw data generated by sequencing platforms often contains technical artifacts, such as adapter sequences and low-quality base calls, which can compromise the accuracy of downstream biological analyses. This project implements a standardized protocol to evaluate, clean, and validate sequencing data, ensuring it meets the rigorous quality standards required for genomic research.

# 3. Initial Quality Assessment (FastQC)
The first phase of the pipeline involves a comprehensive analysis of the raw sequencing files using FastQC. This step is crucial for establishing a baseline understanding of the data's health before any modifications are made.

Per-Base Quality Profiling: This allows for the visualization of Phred quality scores across all reads, identifying if the sequencing chemistry accuracy decreased during the run.

Sequence Content Analysis: Monitoring GC content and base distribution helps detect potential sample contamination or library preparation biases.

Adapter Identification: The tool specifically identifies the presence of synthetic DNA adapters used to attach DNA fragments to the flow cell, which must be removed to prevent alignment errors.

# 4. Sequence Trimming and Adapter Removal (Cutadapt)
Following the initial assessment, the pipeline utilizes Cutadapt to perform precise sequence refinement. This stage is the core processing step of the workflow:

Adapter Excision: The software removes the specific adapter sequences identified in the previous step, ensuring only the biological DNA remains for analysis.

Quality Filtering: Bases at the ends of reads with low confidence scores are removed, which improves the accuracy of subsequent mapping to a reference genome.

Length Filtering: Any reads that fall below a minimum length threshold after trimming are discarded to prevent "multi-mapping," where short sequences match incorrectly across multiple locations on the genome.

# 5. Final Validation and Comparative Analysis (FastQC)
The final stage involves a second execution of the FastQC analysis on the processed data. This round of quality control is essential for the scientific verification of the results:

Comparative Evaluation: By comparing the second report to the initial raw data report, the effectiveness of the trimming process can be quantitatively confirmed.

Data Readiness Verification: This step confirms that the dataset has been successfully optimized. It ensures the removal of technical artifacts, making the data suitable for high-sensitivity tasks such as variant calling or gene expression analysis.

# 6. Workflow Organization
The project is structured with a modular design to ensure clarity and reproducibility. By separating the main workflow logic from the individual tool definitions, the project remains organized and maintainable. All output files are automatically categorized into structured directories, allowing for easy access to raw reports, processed sequence files, and final validation metrics.
